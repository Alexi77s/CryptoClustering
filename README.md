Applied unsupervised learning to predict if there are any changes to cryptocurrencies. Used stadard scaler and scikit-learn to normalize csv file. The original scaled dataframe was utilized to find the best K value to initalized the K-means model. The same process was followed when performing PCA to optimize the clusters.
